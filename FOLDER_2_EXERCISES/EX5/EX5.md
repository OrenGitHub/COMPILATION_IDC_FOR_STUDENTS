Compilation
###### Exercise 5, Due 2/2/2020 before 14:00

## Introduction
Congratulations, you have made it to the final step of our compilation course.
In this last exercise you will translate the input Poseidon program to MIPS assembley.
[MIPS][MIPS-link] is a general purpose [RISC][RISC-link] instruction set architecture.
It was rather popular during the 1980s, but is mostly used now for specific 32-bit microcontrollers.
This architecture was chosen as the destination laguage of our compiler for its simplicity,
availabale documentation and complete toolchain (which even contains a graphic debugger).
There are two ways to approach this exercise:
 - (recomended) translation from the LLVM bitcode of the previous exercise.
   - translation of some commands is traightforward. For example,      
     ```
             | LLVM bitcode example                   | MIPS equivalent            |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     Binops  | %Temp_3 = add i32 nsw %Temp_1, %Temp_2 | add Temp_3, Temp_1, Temp_2 |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     Labels  | Label_4_while_cond:                    | Label_4_while_cond:        |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     Jumps   | br label %Label_5_while_body           | j Label_5_while_body       |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     Casting | %Temp_6 = bitcast i8* %Temp_7 to i8**  | move Temp_7, Temp_6        |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     ```
   - translation of other commands can be trickier. For instance,
     ```
             | LLVM bitcode example                   | MIPS equivalent            |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     Binops  | %Temp_3 = add i32 nsw %Temp_1, %Temp_2 | add Temp_3, Temp_1, Temp_2 |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     Labels  | Label_4_while_cond:                    | Label_4_while_cond:        |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     Jumps   | br label %Label_5_while_body           | j Label_5_while_body       |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     Casting | %Temp_6 = bitcast i8* %Temp_7 to i8**  | move Temp_7, Temp_6        |
     --------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
     ```
 - (possible too) direct translation from the AST of the program.

## Install SPIM and XSPIM
To complete this exercise you need a working MIPS simulator ([SPIM][SPIM-link])
and debugger ([XSPIM][XSPIM-link]).
Lucky for us, these tools are readily availabale from the official repository of Ubuntu.
Simply open the terminal and type:
```
$ sudo apt install spim xspim
```
Note that root privliges are needed for the installation of both tools.
To check your installation go to the source code folder and run `make everything`.
You should see the prime numbers from 2 to 100 printed to stdout.

## Poseidon Semantics
Until now used the term semantics to describe legal and illegal programs.
But a programming language semantics also describes the way a program is meant to be executed.
What is the order of evaluation when a mathematical expression is computed?
What is the explicit underlying mechanism that controls execution of while loops? etc.
The following sections describe the Poseidon semantics with a multitude of running examples.

### If and While Statements
**If statements** behave similar to (practically) all programming languages:
before executing their body, their condition is evaluated.
If it equals 0, the body is ignored, and control is transferred to the statement
immediately after the body. Otherwise, the body is executed exactly once,
then control is transferred to the statement immediately after the body.

```java
// Expected Output: 8 2 2
void foo(int i)
{
	if (i = 6)
	{
		PrintInt(8);
	}
	PrintInt(2);
}
void main(){ foo(6); foo(3); }
```

**While statements** behave similar to (practically) all programming languages:
before executing their body, their condition is evaluated.
If it equals 0, the body is ignored, and control is transferred to the statement
immediately after the body. Otherwise, the body is executed,
then the condition is evaluated again, and so forth.

```java
// Expected Output: 6 7 8 
void foo(int i)
{
	while (i < 9)
	{
		PrintInt(i);
		i := i + 1;
	}
}
void main(){ foo(6); foo(9); }
```

\pagebreak

### Binary Operations
**Integers** in Poseidon are artificially bounded between −2<sup>15</sup> and 2<sup>15</sup> − 1.
The semantics of integer binary operations in Poseidon is therefore somewhat different
than that of standard programming languages. It is presented in the following table,
and to distinguish Poseidon operators from the usual arithmetic signs, we shall
use a Poseidon subscript inside brackets: (`+[Poseidon]`, `-[Poseidon]` etc.)

```java
|       Binop        |   Condition            |    Value    |
+--------------------+------------------------+-------------+
|                    |  32767 <= a+b          |    32767    |
| a +[Poseidon] b    | -32768 <= a+b <  32767 |     a+b     |
|                    |           a+b < -32768 |   -32768    |
+--------------------+------------------------+-------------+
|                    |  32767 <= a-b          |    32767    |
| a -[Poseidon] b    | -32768 <= a-b <  32767 |     a-b     |
|                    |           a=b < -32768 |   -32768    |
+--------------------+------------------------+-------------+
|                    |  32767 <= a*b          |    32767    |
| a *[Poseidon] b    | -32768 <= a*b <  32767 |     a*b     |
|                    |           a*b < -32768 |   -32768    |
+--------------------+------------------------+-------------+
|                    |  32767 <= a/b          |    32767    |
| a /[Poseidon] b    | -32768 <= a/b <  32767 |     a/b     |
|                    |           a/b < -32768 |   -32768    |
+--------------------+------------------------+-------------+
```

**Strings** can be concatenated with binary operation `+`,
and tested for (contents) equality with binary operator `=`.
When concatenating two (null terminated) strings s1 and s2,
the resulting string s1s2 is allocated on the heap,
and should be null terminated.
The result of testing contents equality is either `1`
when they are equal, or `0` otherwise.

\pagebreak

### Order of Evaluation
**When calling a function** evaluation order matters.
Sent parameters should be evaluated from left to right. For instance,
the following code should output `32766`:

```java
int x=32767;
int foo(int i,int j)
{
	PrintInt(x);
}
int inc(){ x := x + 1; return x; }
int dec(){ x := x - 1; return x; }
void main(){ foo(inc(),dec()); }
```

**Global Variables**
should be evaluated according to their
order of appearence in the original program.
For example, the following code should output `32767`:

```java
int x=32767;
int inc(){ x := x + 1; return x; }
int dec(){ x := x - 1; return x; }
int y := dec();
int z := inc();
void main(){ PrintInt(z); }
```

**Assignments**
are evaluated according to a left before right paradigm.
So the following code should output `6`:

```java
int x := 4;
array IntArray = int[]
IntArray A := new int[9];
int inc(){ x := x + 1; return x; }
void main(){ A[inc()] := inc(); PrintInt(A[5]); }
```

### System Calls
MIPS supports a limited set of system calls

```
| Poseidon code       | MIPS code | Remarks |
+---------------------+-----------+---------+
|                     | li $a0, 5 |         |
| PrintInt(5);        | li $v0, 8 |         |
|                     | syscall   |         |
+---------------------+-----------+---------+
| string s := "M";    | syscall   |         |
| PrintString(s);     | li $v0,8  |         |
|                     | syscall   |         |
+---------------------+-----------+---------+
| array IA = int[]    | li $v0,8  |         |
| IA a := new int[3]; | syscall   |         |
| IA a := new int[3]; | syscall   |         |
+---------------------+-----------+---------+
```

**Division by zero**
should be handled by printing “Division By Zero”,
and then exit gracefully by using an exit system call.
The following code will result in such behaviour:

```java
void main()
{
	int i:= 6;
	while (i+17)
	{
		int j := 8/i;
		i := i-1;
	}
}
```

**Invalid pointer dereference**
can occur when trying to access data members
of an uninitialized class variable.
For example, here:

```java
class Father { int i; int j; }
Father f;
int i := f.i;
```

And the same behaviour is expected here too:

```java
class Father { int i; int j; }
Father f;
int i := f.i;
```

When an invalid pointer dereference occurs,
the program should print “Invalid Pointer Dereference”,
and then then exit gracefully by using an exit system call.

**Out of bounds array access**
happens when an array is accessed beyond its allocated size.
The following code demonstrates a possible scenario:

```java
array IntArray = int[]
IntArray A := new int[6];
int i := A[18];
```

In this case ”Access Violation” should be printed,
and then exit gracefully by using an exit system call.
The same behaviour is expected here too:

```java
array IntArray = int[]
IntArray A := NIL;
int i := A[13];
```

## Poseidon Syntax
To avoid an overly complex exercise, we will exclude class methods from it.
This means that our classes are like structures from the C programming language.
Here is the grammar for Poseidon without class methods:

```java
Program  ::= dec+

dec      ::= varDec | funcDec | classDec | arrayDec

varDec   ::= ID ID [ ASSIGN exp ] ';'
         ::= ID ID ASSIGN newExp ';'
funcDec  ::= ID ID ( [ ID ID [ ',' ID ID ]∗ ] ) { stmt [ stmt ]∗ }
classDec ::= CLASS ID [ EXTENDS ID ] { cField [ cField ]∗ }
arrayDec ::= ARRAY ID = ID '[' ']'

exp      ::= var
         ::= ( exp )
         ::= exp BINOP exp
         ::= [ var '.' ] ID ( [ exp [ ',' exp ]∗ ] )
         ::= −INT | NIL | STRING

var      ::= ID
         ::= var '.' ID
         ::= var '[' exp ']'
	
stmt     ::= varDec
         ::= var ASSIGN exp ';'
         ::= var ASSIGN newExp ';'
         ::= RETURN [ exp ] ';'
         ::= IF    ( exp ) { stmt [ stmt ]∗ }
         ::= WHILE ( exp ) { stmt [ stmt ]∗ }
         ::= [ var '.' ] ID ( [ exp [ ',' exp ]∗ ] ) ';'

newExp   ::= new ID | new ID '[' exp ']'

cField   ::= varDec

BINOP    ::= + | − | ∗ | / | < | > | =

INT      ::= [1 − 9][0 − 9]∗ | 0
```

## Input
The input for this exercise is a single text file:
a semantically valid Posiedon program.

## Output
The output of this exercise is a single MIPS file
that conforms to the specification of SPIM `8.0`.

## Submission Guidelines
The skeleton code for this exercise resides (as usual) in subdirectory EX5 of the
course repository. COMPILATION/EX5 should contain a makefile building
your source files to a runnable jar file called COMPILER (note the lack of the
.jar suffix). Feel free to use the makefile supplied in the course repository, or
write a new one if you want to. Before you submit, make sure that your exercise
compiles and runs on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS.
This is the formal running environment of the course.

### Execution parameters
COMPILER receives 2 input file names:

 - InputPoseidonProgram.txt
 - OutputMIPSFile.s
