# Compilation
###### Exercise 4, Due 5/1/2020 before 14:00

## Introduction
For the first time ever we are going to compile Poseidon programs to LLVM bitcode.
[LLVM](https://llvm.org/) is an open source compiler infraructure that supports
multiple source languages (C, CPP, C#, Go, etc.) and multiple destination targets
(x86, ARM, MIPS, x86_64, sparc, etc.).
In order to make this document self contained,
all the information needed to complete the fourth exercise is in this document.

## Install LLVM
Download and install LLVM/clang [with this script](https://github.com/OrenGitHub/COMPILATION_IDC_FOR_STUDENTS/blob/master/FOLDER_3_SOURCE_CODE/EX4/FOLDER_9_SCRIPTS/build-llvm-6.0.0) 

```java
class Father extends Grandfather { int i; int j; }
int Check(Father f)
{
	if (f = nil)
	{
	    return 333;
	}
	    return 774;
	}
}
```
```java
class Father extends Grandfather { int i; int j; }
int Check(Father f)
{
	if (f = nil)
	{
	    return 800;
	}
	    return 774;
	}
}
```
