% Regex to NFA %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Regex to NFA is a simple recursive algorithm

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Itemize begin %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}

\item Suppose $M_{i}$ is an NFA representing regex $r_{i}$
\item Which NFA represents $r_{1}   r_{2}$?
\item Which NFA represents $r_{1} | r_{2}$?
\item Which NFA represents $r_{1}^{*}$?

\item Regex to NFA base cases

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Itemize begin %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}

\item If $r_{1} = $ a, what is $M_{1}$?
\item If $r_{1}$ is the empty set, what is $M_{1}$?
\item If $r_{1}$ is the empty string, what is $M_{1}$?
